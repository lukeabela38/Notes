## Cloud Computing 

Client - Server Model
1. Client interacts with and makes requests to a computer server.
2. Server does tasks and return information

## Deployment Models

Cloud Based Deployment:
1. Everything runs on the cloud
2. Build or move Applications to the Cloud
3. Virtual Servers, Databases, Networking Components all based in the cloud

On Premises Deployment (Private):
1. Applications run on technology fully kept on-premises

Hybrid Deployment:
1. Connect cloud resources to an on-premises infrasturcture

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

1. Cost savings, security, scalability, flexibility
2. Using Cloud means you do not have to invest in a data center, servers, etc etc ...
3. Cloud Computing is a variable expense, and hence can be managed
4. Consume more resources as you grow
5. No resources or staffing are necessary to operate the data center
6. Flexible capacity allows you to shrink or grow as required
7. Economies at Scale: Share resources with other to lower overall csosts
8. Incereased Speed, especially for research and development
9. Global reach -> deploy apps to consumers everywhere
